# davserver

This is my first real open source project. It is a try to build a java implementation of WebDAV (RFC4918) with additional support for CalDAV and CardDAV. 

It is an learning project to get a protocol implementation.
 
THE PROJECT IS WORK IN PROGRESS and no useful release is done yet.

For testing surpose i will try to get this framework running against the litmus project (https://github.com/tolsen/litmus).
